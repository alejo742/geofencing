# To-Do

## This file is for tracking tasks and ideas related to the Evergreen Geofencing project.

### Tasks:
- [ ] Handle cases when walking polygon won't overlap with the normal polygon
- [ ] Improve user experience when adding points (walking and clicking)
- [ ] Improve styling and interface (e.g. visual error messages, and intuitive & pretty UI).
- [ ] Enable data persistence by allowing imports and exports in both JSON files or JSON-formatted text.

### Fixes:
- [ ] Test and fix the walking functionality (can't test it since I am in Peru!)
- [ ] Test and fix the trigger band functionality (can't test it since I am in Peru!)

### Enhancements:
- [ ] Add layer control/toggles for polygon types and structures
- [ ] Improve documentation on README (specifications changed in the real project).
