# To-Do

## This file is for tracking tasks and ideas related to the Evergreen Geofencing project.

### Enhancements:
- [ ] Improve documentation on README (specifications changed in the real project).
- [ ] Improve styling and interface (e.g. visual error messages, popup/tooltip confirmation, and intuitive & pretty UI).
- [ ] Enable data persistence by allowing imports and exports in both JSON files or JSON-formatted text.
